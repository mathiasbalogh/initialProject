# Initial Project for Prime

This is a README document for our first Prime project!
1. index.html
	* This is the backbone of the project where the most of the content will be held.
2. styles.css
	* This is the a stylesheet that will make the project have more style than a plain document.
3. app.js
	* This is the JavaScript text file that will make the project an interactive experience for the user.
